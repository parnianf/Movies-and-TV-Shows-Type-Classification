# Netflix-And-Amazon-Movies-and-TV-Shows-Classification



In this project, the aim is to get acquainted with machine learning methods by `scikit-learn` library. 

This project is defined in four phases:
  * Phase 0: I should review and analyze the data
  * Phase 1: I will get acquainted with preprocessing methods, then extract features from the text columns. 
  * Phase 2: I predict the target and optimize these models.
  * Phase 3: I become familiar with Ensemble methods and compare the results of these types of models with the results of the previous phase.

The dataset provided is a collection of movies and TV series available on the **Netflix** and **Amazon**. This dataset contains the features of `title`, `cast`, `country`, `release_year`, `listed_in`, `type`(Movie or TV series), and `description`. 

In this project, I will predict the type of movie column.
