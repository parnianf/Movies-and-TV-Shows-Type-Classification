# Netflix-And-Amazon-Movies-and-TV-Shows-Classification


This project aims to classify movies and TV shows based on their type (i.e., movies or TV shows) using machine learning algorithms. 


This project is defined in four phases:
  * Phase 0: Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
  * Phase 1: Handling Missing Values, Normalization & Standardization, Handling Categorical Data, Handling series of data in a cell, Feature Extraction
  * Phase 2: Prediction and Optimiztaion, Tuning hyper-parameters, Study Effect of Depth on Accuracy
  * Phase 3: Predicting by Ensembling Methods, Tuning hyper-parameters, Study Effect of Depth on Accuracy, Study Effect of Number of Estimators on Accuracy, Bias vs Variance: Random Forest and Decision Tree

The dataset provided is a collection of movies and TV series available on the **Netflix** and **Amazon**. This dataset contains the features of `title`, `cast`, `country`, `release_year`, `listed_in`, `type`(Movie or TV series), and `description`. 

In this project, I will predict the type of movie column.
